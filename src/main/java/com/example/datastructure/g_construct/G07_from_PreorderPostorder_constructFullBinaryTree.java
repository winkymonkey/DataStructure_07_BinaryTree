	 * It is not possible to construct a general Binary Tree from PreOrder and PostOrder traversals
	 * But if know that the Binary Tree is Full, we can construct the tree without ambiguity.

	 * ------------------
	 * STEP-1
	 * ------------------
	 * PRE[] =  {1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 3, 6, 7}
	 * POST[] = {8, 9, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3, 1};
	 * 
	 * in PRE[], the leftmost element is root of tree. (so 1 is root)
	 * hence in PRE[], the next value of root must be left-child. (so 2 is left-child)
	 * so we know 1 is root and 2 is left child
	 * how to find the all nodes in left subtree?
	 * We know 2 is root of all nodes in left subtree.
	 * so, all nodes before 2 in post[] must be in left subtree.
	 * 
	 *              1

	 *          /       \
	 *   {8,9,4,5,2}  {6,7,3}
	 * so,
	 * PRE =  {2, 4, 8, 9, 5}             PRE =  {3, 6, 7}
	 * POST = {8, 9, 4, 5, 2}             POST = {6, 7, 3}
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ------------------
	 * STEP-2
	 * ------------------
	 * in PRE[], the leftmost element is root of tree. (so 2 is root)
	 * hence in PRE[], the next value of root must be left-child. (so 4 is left-child)
	 * so we know 2 is root and 4 is left child
	 * how to find the all nodes in left subtree?
	 * We know 4 is root of all nodes in left subtree.
	 * so, all nodes before 4 in post[] must be in left subtree.
