/**
 * ************************************************************************************************************
 * Given a binary tree and two values say n1 and n2, write a program to find the least common ancestor.
 * ************************************************************************************************************
 * The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined 
 * as the lowest node in the tree that has both n1 and n2 as descendants 
 * (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).
 * 
 * The LCA of n1 and n2 in the tree is the shared ancestor of n1 and n2 that is located farthest from the root.
 * 
 * Computation of lowest common ancestors may be useful as part of a procedure for determining the distance between pairs of nodes in a tree:
 * the distance from n1 to n2 can be computed as the distance from the root to n1,
 * plus the distance from the root to n2
 * minus twice the distance from the root to their LCA

 *   4   5 6   7
 *  /           \

 * LCA(4, 5) = 2

	 * ----------------------
	 * Traverse the tree starting from the root.
	 * If any of the given keys n1 or n2 matches with the root, then the root is LCA.
	 * If the root doesnâ€™t match with any of the keys, we recur for the left and right subtree.
	 *  - The node which has one key present in its left subtree and the another key in the right subtree is the LCA.
	 *  - If both keys lie in the left subtree, then the left subtree has LCA also, otherwise, LCA lies in the right subtree.
